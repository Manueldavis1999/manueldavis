# CURRENT IT SETUP


Currently system is deployed in on-premise infrastructure.




## Advantages of On-Premises Storage

• ***Operate without Internet:*** One of the major upsides to on-premises storage is that it does not require users to have
an internet connection to access data. On-premises servers will provide you with an internal network that is accessible 
anytime, no matter your internet connection.


• ***Lower monthly internet costs:*** If your business doesn't rely on the internet or cloud based services, you may no need to pay
for such a high speed connection. For those with on-premises storage, the need for a strong connection with fast download
speeds is reduced even further.

• ***Provide greater Security:*** Unlike cloud storage, which is more vnlnerable to third parties and prying eyes, on-premises
is completely restricted from anyone other than authorized person. These are not accessible to those outside the network,as 
they are not storing the data online.



## Why on- premises storage may not be the best option?

Despite the many advantages that come with on-premises storage, there are some drawbacks companies should be aware of. 
On-premises storage may not be the best choice for your business because it can

• ***Require extra IT support:*** If you decide you want to use on-premises storage, you’ll also need to have IT staff 
to maintain and manage your servers.


• ***Increase maintenence cost:*** Along with the initial capital investment required to purcahse servers and other hardware,and also need to continue 
to buy hardware,software and lisences to upgrade the system or repair it.


• ***Increase the risk of data loss:*** With on-premises storage, a malfunction in the system or a 
compromised system held for ransom can cause you to lose your data permanently.
 

• ***Require a greater capital investment:*** When you first set up on-premises storage, you’ll have to invest a significant
 amount of capital to purchase the servers and other pieces of hardware to get it running. 



## Introducing a CLOUD TECHNOLOGY to the Enterprise (NeST Digital)

# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## What is AWS?

***The most complete and widely used cloud platform in the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides over 200 fully functional services from data centers across the world.
Compared to other cloud providers, AWS offers a significantly greater number of services and features within those services, ranging from infrastructure technologies like compute,
 storage, and databases to cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data lakes, and the Internet of Things. As a result, moving your current applications 
to the cloud is quicker, simpler, and more cost-effective, and you can construct almost anything you can think of.***

AWS also has the deepest functionality within those services. For example, AWS offers the widest variety of databases that are purpose-built for different types of applications so you 
can choose the right tool for the job to get the best cost and performance.

## Services offered by AWS Cloud 

• ***Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):*** IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), 
and data storage space. IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources.

• ***Platform as a Service (PaaS):*** PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the 
deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, 
or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 

• ***Software as a Service (SaaS):*** SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user 
applications (such as web-based email). With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think 
about how you will use that particular software.

## Proposed deployment of architecture in cloud

Deployment architecture of a cloud-ready application is invariably influenced by services provided by the cloud vendor.
Being an application that requires operation under stringent complaince and data residency considerations, choice of cloud services 
become more important.

## Why AWS is the bset option?

One of the primary ways the cloud interacts with your company is in the way it stores data. Unlike an on-premises servers with storage, 
cloud storage uses external servers managed by another company.

A primary function of any business is the ability to store data in servers. After all, servers are the lifeblood of your organization.
 They store your information, connect your employees and allow you to connect with others around the world. In the past, on-site servers 
were the only options available to you, but now, cloud-based servers are a viable option as well.


• ***Reduce IT staff’s responsibilities:*** As your cloud storage will be managed by another company, your IT staff won’t have to take the time to install 
new software patches or updates, freeing up their time for other tasks.

• ***Elimiinate capital expenses:*** While on-premises storage is considered a capital expense, cloud is considered as an operational expense. Typically 
on-premises storage requires a large initial investment to purchse equipment and install it in the office.

• ***Perform regular data backups:*** The cloud offers easier data backup than on-premises server ever could.Cloud-based servers give users peace of mind 
because they know if their computer goes haywire or their local files are deleted, they can find the information again. This ability to access information 
that would otherwise be lost means your company can minimize the risk of losing critical information.


# CONCLUSION



***Why AWS ?***

• ***Affordability:*** Generally, costs are lower for cloud-based applications. Instead of having to pay a large licensing fee upfront, 
you’ll have much lower monthly costs. Often times, these monthly costs take the form of subscription fees.

• ***Ease of deployment:*** One of the biggest advantages of cloud computing is its ability 
to be deployed quickly without long installation processes.

• ***Management services:*** One major aspect of cloud computing is the management services that vendors will typically offer clients. 
Instead of having to host the software or purchase hardware themselves, a customer can work with a vendor who will take care of it all externally, 
freeing up staff and reducing costs 


Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple 
redundant sites on the cloud provider's network.
