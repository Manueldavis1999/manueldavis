# CURRENT IT SETUP


Currently system is deployed in on-premise infrastructure.



## Cloud Storage vs. On-Premises Storage 

Choosing to store your data on external servers or in-house servers is a major decision 
that companies must consider. As you look at the pros and cons of on-premises and cloud storage,
 you should be knowledgeable about their most important qualities.


## Advantages of On-Premises Storage

• ***Operate without Internet:*** One of the major upsides to on-premises storage is that it does not require users to have
an internet connection to access data. On-premises servers will provide you with an internal network that is accessible 
anytime, no matter your internet connection.


• ***Lower monthly internet costs:*** If your business doesn't rely on the internet or cloud based services, you may no need to pay
for such a high speed connection. For those with on-premises storage, the need for a strong connection with fast download
speeds is reduced even further.

• ***Provide greater Security:*** Unlike cloud storage, which is more vnlnerable to third parties and prying eyes, on-premises
is completely restricted from anyone other than authorized person. These are not accessible to those outside the network,as 
they are not storing the data online.

• ***Offer control over server hardware:*** Instead of having to ask a cloud storage company to upgrade their storage plan
or add new features , the company can simply do the upgrades themselves.


## Why on- premises storage may not be the best option?

Despite the many advantages that come with on-premises storage, there are some drawbacks companies should be aware of. 
On-premises storage may not be the best choice for your business because it can

• ***Require extra IT support:*** If you decide you want to use on-premises storage, you’ll also need to have IT staff 
to maintain and manage your servers.


• ***Increase maintenence cost:*** Along with the initial capital investment required to purcahse servers and other hardware,and also need to continue 
to buy hardware,software and lisences to upgrade the system or repair it.


• ***Increase the risk of data loss:*** With on-premises storage, a malfunction in the system or a 
compromised system held for ransom can cause you to lose your data permanently.
 

• ***Require a greater capital investment:*** When you first set up on-premises storage, you’ll have to invest a significant
 amount of capital to purchase the servers and other pieces of hardware to get it running. 



## Introducing a CLOUD TECHNOLOGY to the Enterprise (NeST Digital)

# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## What is AWS?

***The most complete and widely used cloud platform in the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides over 200 fully functional services from data centers across the world.
Compared to other cloud providers, AWS offers a significantly greater number of services and features within those services, ranging from infrastructure technologies like compute,
 storage, and databases to cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data lakes, and the Internet of Things. As a result, moving your current applications 
to the cloud is quicker, simpler, and more cost-effective, and you can construct almost anything you can think of.***
